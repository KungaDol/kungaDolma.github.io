Welcome to my website! I am Kunga Dolma, a senior at Mount Holyoke College majoring in Statistics. Iâ€™m originally from Nepal and Tibet, and I celebrate Tibetan Losar, one of my favorite cultural traditions.

I enjoy reading Webtoons, watching football, and hiking in my free time. My academic and professional interests include sports analytics, marketing, and health data analysis.
